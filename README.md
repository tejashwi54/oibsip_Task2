Task 2:
Unemployment Analysis

Task Overview:
--> This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python. The goal is to gain insights into the unemployment rates by visualizing and interpreting the provided data. This analysis will help understand the impact of unemployment in various regions of the country.

The dataset used in this project contains information about unemployment rates across different states in India, categorized by regions. It also includes dates and other relevant economic factors.

Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate insights through visualizations, such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.

Regional Comparison: Analyze unemployment rates across different regions of India.

Time Series Analysis: Study the trend of unemployment over time.
